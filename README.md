**User management** describes the ability for administrators to manage user access to various IT resources like systems, devices, applications, storage systems, networks and more. **User management** is a core part to any directory service and is a basic security essential for any organization. **User management** enables admins to control user access and **on-board** and **off-board** users to and from IT resources. Subsequently a directory service will then **authenticate**, **authorize**, and **audit user access** to IT resources based on what the **IT admin** had dictated.

## Roles and App Permissions
**Organization users** can be assigned one of two roles: **Admin** or **Member**. An organization can have any number of each role, but must have at least one **admin user**. In addition to their member role in the **organization**, **members** can be assigned app permissions on specific **apps** owned by the organization.
